This practise is seen in veterinary, training, vending and keeping circles alike. PC is usually achieved by creating a barrier for interactions. In venomous trades, this may be called air-locking; in other exotic hobby circles like our ownâ€”this may be coined the bag method; in positive reinforcement and training communities, this is known as a form of management.
All forms of protected contact focalise the same concept: To minimise the amount of risk and stress that come with standard procedures where interaction may be required. This may be especially useful with animals that may be reactive, fast, or medically significant.`]})}function a(e={}){const{wrapper:t}=e.components||{};return t?n(t,{...e,children:n(i,{...e})}):i(e)}const f="src/content/docs/Protocols/pc.mdx",y="/home/runner/work/myc0sis.github.io/myc0sis.github.io/src/content/docs/Protocols/pc.mdx",o=(e={})=>a({...e,components:{Fragment:s,...e.components,"astro-image":e.components?.img??r}});o[Symbol.for("mdx-component")]=!0;o[Symbol.for("astro.needsHeadRendering")]=!c.layout;o.moduleId="/home/runner/work/myc0sis.github.io/myc0sis.github.io/src/content/docs/Protocols/pc.mdx";export{o as Content,g as __usesAstroImage,o as default,y as file,c as frontmatter,h as getHeadings,f as url};

“Effectiveness is one criterion, but effectiveness alone is not enough-

When an animal’s attempts to escape aversive events are blocked they tend to give up trying even when their power to escape is restored. This phenomenon, called learned helplessness, has been replicated with a wide variety of animal species (e.g., dogs, cats, monkeys, cockroaches, children, adult humans)” Friedman, S. G. (2018).

## Procedural Hierarchy of Intrusiveness


### Determining intervention and levels of intrusion

**Intrusiveness** refers to the degree of counter-control, choice, and consent for the recipient- in context of spiders minimization of stress is always an area of relevant concern. Here are some steps we might take to evaluate intrusiveness:

- If a less intrusive procedure can accomplish the desired behavior change, it is neither necessary nor ethical to use a more intrusive procedure.
   
- If the choice is between a less intrusive but ineffective procedure and a more aversive but effective procedure, the effective procedure should be selected.

- Before employing a more intrusive procedure, data should be collected to substantiate the ineffectiveness of the less intrusive approach.

"Effectiveness is one criterion, but effectiveness alone is not enough-

When an animalâ€™s attempts to escape aversive events are blocked they tend to give up trying even when their power to escape is restored. This phenomenon, called learned helplessness, has been replicated with a wide variety of animal species (e.g., dogs, cats, monkeys, cockroaches, children, adult humans)" *Friedman, S. G. (2018).*

## Procedural Hierarchy of Intrusiveness


### Determining intervention and levels of intrusion

**Intrusiveness** refers to the degree of counter-control, choice, and consent for the recipient- in context of spiders minimization of stress is always an area of relevant concern. Here are some steps we might take to evaluate intrusiveness:

- If a less intrusive procedure can accomplish the desired behavior change, it is neither necessary nor ethical to use a more intrusive procedure.
   
- If the choice is between a less intrusive but ineffective procedure and a more aversive but effective procedure, the effective procedure should be selected.

- Before employing a more intrusive procedure, data should be collected to substantiate the ineffectiveness of the less intrusive approach.

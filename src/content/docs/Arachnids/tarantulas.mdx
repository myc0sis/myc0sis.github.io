### Preface

This wiki article aims to address keeper challenges and offer a clear overview of tarantulas and their captive care using evidence-based information translated simplistically. We hope that keepers can use this text to help educate themselves and others- equipped with a concise, modern, and well-thought-out resource compiling decades of literary information formatted for keepers of all skill levels.

## Basic Sling Care

Spiderling care generally covers the following areas:

- **Enclosure**  
- **Substrate**  
- **Hide/Retreat**  
- **Ventilation**  
- **Moisture needs**

**Fossorial**, **terrestrial**, and **arboreal** tarantulas have different care needs, often minor.

### Feeding

- Feed slings every 3-7 days with maimed or pre-killed prey smaller than the tarantula’s leg span. Prey item's limbs or segments can be used if small prey isn't available.
  - **Key note**: *the quality of care and diet for feeders is crucial to prevent toxin contamination, accumulation, and illness. Always provide fresh, untreated produce, and regularly check for fungal growth, bacterial contamination, or pests in feeder colonies and food sources. Feeding practices may vary based on species, individual needs, and circumstances. Seek a second opinion when needed and stay open to adapting your approach.*


### Watering

- Arid species should generally be kept dry but may benefit from a light moisture gradient; moisture-dependent species need a gradient of moisture, with important consideration not to let the habitat dry out.
  - **Key note**: *"gradient" generally refers to a top-to-bottom moisture level, drier on the surface and more moisture the deeper the individual goes.*
- Misting in moderation can be appreciated but is generally considered an inadequate form of hydration. Physical water dishes are almost always optimal, with the exception of some species, that do not break surface tension and subsequently become trapped in too-large of water droplets.
 - **Key note**: *"some species" generally refer to sizes comparative to spiderling of salticids, dwarf tarantulas, or other especially small species. (0.25"/0.6cm) In other cases, smaller water dishes can be crafted out of [ink caps](https://amzn.to/3ZqdLx9) and [legos](https://amzn.to/4gq7Deq).*

### Molting

- Feed slings 1 week after molting, extending to 10-14 days once they are 2 inches or larger.
- Before molting, the exoskeleton will darken. Remove uneaten food and ensure the enclosure remains humid.
  - **Key note**: *internal hydration and reserves are the most important factors in molting health.*

## Basic Tarantula Care 


### Enclosure

**Terrestrial**: Use long, low tanks where floor space matters more than height. The distance between the substrate and the lid shouldn’t exceed the tarantula’s leg span. A 5-gallon aquarium or similarly sized container works well.

**Arboreal**: Tanks should prioritize height over floor space. Use tanks 2-4x times the tarantula’s leg span. 

**Fossorial**: Provide deep substrate (minimum 1.5x the leg span) for burrowing species. Taller, narrower tanks allow better viewing.

**Decor**: Fake plants, cork bark, and live plants are good options. Avoid sharp objects like jagged rocks.
 
- **Key note**: *Plants may not be sustainable or optimal, so be sure to consider your individual's species-specific care. Additionally, toxins or intruders may be introduced, so careful consideration is needed.*


**Substrate**: Choose a substrate that is preference or standard to your species specific care. Ingredients should never be treated, sharp, or jagged.


**Feeding**: Feed adult tarantulas 1-2 times a week with prey that doesn’t exceed the size of their body (prosoma and opisthosoma). Suitable feeders include crickets, roaches, superworms, mealworms, and locusts, larvae and more. Gutload feeders with quality food, such as fresh vegetables. Feeders should be removed within a day or less.
 
   - **Key note**: *feeder quality of care and diet are important areas of concern in regards to toxin contamination, accumulation, and illness. Always be sure to feed fresh untreated produce and avoid fungal, bacterial, and intruder status in feeder colonies and food-stuff. feeding practice can differ depending on individual, species, and circumstance. Remember to get a second opinion and be open to change.* 


**Water**: Provide a water dish for all tarantulas, including slings. Avoid cotton, sponges, or water gels, as these harbor bacteria. If the dish is too large, add some aquarium gravel to prevent drowning. Mist can sometimes be appreciated but humidity spiking can come with health risks.


**Heating**: If your home stays around 70°F, no additional heating is required. For temperatures below 65°F, use a low-wattage heat source, such as a ceramic heat emitter or heat mat. Avoid heat rocks, basking bulbs, UV bulbs, or placing heat mats under the tank.


**Molting**: Tarantulas grow by shedding their exoskeleton. Signs of an impending molt include darkened exoskeleton, refusal to eat, and laying down a web mat. Do not disturb a tarantula during or after molting, as they are very fragile. Wait about 2 weeks before feeding.

### Sexing

There are two common methods:

- **Epiandrous fusillae (vent sexing)**: Checking hair positioning and direction on the vent, which can require expanding research and practice.

- **Spermathecae (molt sexing)**: Inspecting the molt for spermathecae, a small flap indicating a female. Males exhibit differences after their ultimate molt, such as leggier bodies and sometimes color changes. Males also develop emboli on their pedipalps and, in many species, tibial hooks.

## Disorders
﻿

### Toxins

- **Nicotine**:
  - **Cigarette Smoke:** No reported 'intoxication'.
  - **Nicotine Residue:** Intoxication, nicotine poisoning. Cross-contamination is the primary cause of intoxication.
- **Fipronil (Frontline):** 
  - Toxic 
  - Linked to ataxia, “DKS” 
  - Acaricides 
  - Pyrethroids. 
  - Captive-treated pets are a primary cause of intoxication. 
  - Exposure to insecticide/pesticides may result in neurological decline commonly called  'dyskinetic syndrome' (DKS), characterized by jittery, seizure-like limb movements.
- **Plant Toxins:** Accumulated in prey items
  - Nightshade? Treated? 
- **Mold:** 
  - Opportunistic bacteria 
  - Pathogens

﻿
### Parasites  

- **Predators and parasites can host switch or behave unusually.**
- **Mermithidae Nematodes:** Paratenic consumption/infiltration/internal.
- **Panagrolaimidae Nematodes:** 
  - Oral/external. 
  - Often suspected to belong to the Panagrolaimidae family. 
  - Symptoms include anorexia, lethargy, unusual postures, and white discharge from the oral cavity. 
  - These infections are often linked to bacterial infiltration and necrosis.
- **Ichneumonidae Wasp**
- **Pompilidae Wasp:** Spider wasp.
- **Sphecidae:** Mud daubers.
- **Acroceridae:** Spider fly.
- **Phoridae:** Humpback fly.
- **Parasitic & Saprophytic Mites:**
  - Concerns with mite origin and potential pathogens.
  - Mite lifestyle and feeding habits may also be of concern.
  - Parasitism represents a low percent of cases.  
﻿

### Conditions  

- **Cuticular Trauma**:
  - Minor damage may be treated passively with cornstarch as a wound sealant.
  - Severe damage and tears generally require superglue adhesive (ethyl - cyanoacrylate) in liquid form. Multiple layers may be necessary.
  - Hemolymph loss can be severe and should be minimized.
  - 'Complete cuticular trauma' (severe tears) - addressing this issue in a hobby setting is extremely challenging with poor prognosis. Fluid support is essential, and sutures are generally not recommended.
  - Future molts may be affected.
- **Opisthosoma Alopecia**:
  - Hair loss is part of the ecdysis process.
  - Stress may contribute.
- **Anorexia**:
  - Inadequate housing parameters are a primary source.
  - Behavioural suppression 'learned helplessness,' stress, and fear may contribute.
  - Disease may contribute.
- **Maturation**: 
  - MM: Terminal ecdysis.
  - Confirmation through emboli presence and tibial spurs where applicable.
  - Some genera and species may lack spurs.
- **Dysecdysis**:
  - Primarily hydration-related.
  - Some causes of past trauma may contribute.
  - Dysecdysis can present as delayed, partial, or complete failure to shed the old exoskeleton.
- **Growths**:
  - Fungal/bacterial - Infectious granuloma.
  - No reported oncological evidence.
  - Poor hygiene may contribute. Weak betadine solution is suggested daily until visually improved.
  - Reinfection concerns.
- **Autotomy**:
  - Limb removal may be a result of inadequate housing parameters.
  - Autotomy is most appropriate for the walking legs and should be performed as a last resort. 
  - Intruders or injurious materials/events may contribute.
- **Ataxia - DKS Symptoms**:
  - Primary sources seem to be intoxication.
  - Dyskinetic syndrome (DKS) may also result from systemic fungal or bacterial infections.
  - Physical damage or infection may contribute.
﻿
- **Oral nematodes additional information**:
 - Our AMA with one of the researchers on Tarantobelus jeffdanielsi [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tarantulas/comments/1amx0yz/jacob_schurkman_phd_microbiology_nematodes_ama/). You can find their research [here.](https://discord.com/channels/306336628459438083/338849458802524161/933554792855404634) & [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1645/21-42)
 - Unclear transmission.
 - Phorid fly may be mechanical vectors.
 - **Tenebrio sp. (potentially molitor)**: Mealworm custodians may contaminate crickets.
 - May be zoonotic (related species of nematodes infect humans).
 - Infected animals' bites may infect humans.

## Handling - Overview

### Why is handling not recommended

- The danger to you: tarantulas are generally solitary reactive animals, making them difficult to predict or manage. Even if you think you know your tarantula, unexpected consequences are always a risk. 

- The danger to the tarantula: a fall of just a few inches can injure or kill many species of tarantulas depending on circumstances (such as distance, fall breakage, positional landing, and so on). Tarantulas, being solitary animals, generally want to be left alone and excessive stressful stimuli can be damaging long-term. Additionally, the tarantula could escape.

- The danger to the hobby: if you or someone you know gets bit or gets urticating hairs in their eyes/lungs it could require a visit to the doctor. Imagine the potential negative press this could create for our hobby. Additionally, if you are presenting an animal in front of others, it may leave further negative impressions, making the world a harder place for spiders and their keepers.


### Why a keeper might handle and how-to

- Physical intervention: intervention and management may sometimes be unavoidable- although rare, it can be important to have the necessary awareness and mechanical ability to handle a tarantula.
  
 - **Key note**: *when addressing a challenge in your keeping, it is usually best practice to use the [path of least intrusion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tarantulas/wiki/tarantulas/protocol/) Hands-on intervention is generally considered a last resort.*


- When physical intervention is unavoidable, safety measures should be considered: keeping low to the ground and selection of an environment with minimal disturbances.

- Contact with an individual and the outside environment offers a host of risks, such as stressful stimuli or toxin contamination. 

 - **Key note**: *remember to always wash your hands before and after interactions. Individual and specie specific criteria may encourage PPE protection to be used, such as gloves, long sleeves, or eye protection.*

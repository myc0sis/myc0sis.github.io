## <p style="text-align:center;">Jumping Spiders Overview</p>

<br/><br/>

## Basic Care for Spiderlings (Slings)

Jumping spider spiderlings (slings) require the following essential care elements:

- **Enclosure**  
- **Substrate**  
- **Hides/Retreats**  
- **Ventilation**  
- **Humidity & Moisture**

**Feeding**: Feed slings every 2-4 days with small, live prey like flightless fruit flies (Drosophila hydei or melanogaster). Prey size should not exceed the sling's body size.
  - **Keynote**: *Ensure feeder insects are gut-loaded with nutritious food to maintain your spider's health. Check the feeding source regularly for contamination or pests.*

**Watering**: Spiderlings generally derive moisture from their prey, but lightly misting their enclosure occasionally is recommended. Ensure that any water droplets provided are appropriately sized to avoid drowning risks.
  - **Keynote**: *Some species and individuals, particularly smaller spiderlings, may struggle with large water droplets. Tiny water droplets can be created by misting lightly or using a pipette.*

**Molting**: Spiderlings will molt as they grow. Ensure the enclosure remains adequately humid, and remove any uneaten prey before molting to avoid stress or injury.
  - **Keynote**: *Proper hydration is critical for a successful molt. Post-molt, wait 1-2 days before feeding.*

## Basic Adult Jumping Spider Care

### Enclosure

Jumping spiders are arboreal, requiring vertical space to explore and jump. A tall enclosure with plenty of height for webbing and perching is ideal. The enclosure should be well-ventilated with a secure lid to prevent escapes.

- **Terrestrial Space**: While jumping spiders do not require extensive ground space, having a moderate floor area with climbing structures is beneficial.

**Decor**: Provide objects like twigs, leaves, or fake plants for your spider to perch on and explore. Be cautious of sharp or potentially hazardous items in the enclosure.

**Substrate**: A thin layer of coconut fiber or soil can be used, though it primarily serves aesthetic purposes rather than function. Ensure that the substrate is clean and free from pesticides or contaminants.

**Feeding**: Adults can be fed every 2-5 days with appropriately sized live prey, such as crickets, small roaches, or flies. Feeders should not exceed the spider's body length.
  - **Keynote**: *Proper nutrition for feeder insects is essential to avoid health issues for your spider. Remove uneaten prey within a day to maintain enclosure hygiene.*

**Water**: Provide a small water source, or mist lightly every few days. Jumping spiders typically drink from droplets on enclosure walls or decorations.
  - **Keynote**: *Avoid water gels or sponges, as these can harbor harmful bacteria. Always use clean, untreated water.*

**Heating**: Jumping spiders thrive in typical room temperatures of 70-80°F (21-27°C). If temperatures drop below 65°F (18°C), a small heat source may be necessary. Avoid direct heat sources such as heat lamps or mats placed under the enclosure.

**Molting**: Adult spiders will molt less frequently than slings but may still exhibit pre-molt behavior such as reduced activity and food refusal. Ensure that the enclosure is adequately humid during molting periods.

## Sexing

There are a few methods to determine the sex of jumping spiders:

- **Visual Inspection**: Males are typically smaller, with more pronounced coloration and larger, more prominent pedipalps. Females tend to have larger abdomens, especially when gravid.
  
- **Behavioral Cues**: Males often display courtship behavior, such as leg-waving or dancing, which is uncommon in females.

 - **Keynote**: *For more precise methods, visual or molt sexing guides can provide additional insight.*

## Disorders and Common Health Issues

### Toxins

Jumping spiders can be sensitive to various environmental toxins:

- **Nicotine**: Exposure to nicotine from cigarette smoke can be harmful or fatal. Keep enclosures away from smoke or other airborne pollutants.
- **Pesticides**: Avoid using pesticides around the spider’s enclosure or in areas where prey items are sourced. Pesticides can lead to neurological damage or death.

### Parasites

- **Mites**: Mites can be introduced via feeder insects or substrate. Regular cleaning and monitoring can help prevent infestations.
- **Nematodes**: Parasitic nematodes can sometimes be found in prey, leading to health declines in spiders.

### Conditions

- **Molting Complications**: Inadequate humidity or stress can lead to incomplete or failed molts. Ensure the environment is properly maintained to avoid molting issues.
- **Dehydration**: Symptoms of dehydration include lethargy, shrunken abdomen, and curled legs. Regular misting and proper hydration are essential.

 - **Keynote**: *Always monitor molting closely and avoid disturbing the spider during this vulnerable time.*

## <p style="text-align:center;"> Handling - Overview</p>

### Handling Considerations

- **Risk to the Spider**: Jumping spiders are agile but fragile creatures. A fall from a short height can result in injury or death. Handle with care, keeping low to the ground and in a secure space to minimize risks.
  
- **Stress**: Handling may cause unnecessary stress to the spider, impacting its long-term health and behavior. Minimal handling is advised, with observation being the primary form of interaction.

- **Escape Risk**: Jumping spiders are fast and can escape easily. Ensure all handling is done in an environment where escape is minimized.

 - **Keynote**: *Always wash hands before and after handling to reduce the risk of transferring harmful substances or stress-inducing odors.*
